Hello,
My goal is too help to discover the best products on Etsy, curated by a community with great taste.
Curated site features beautiful and functional products, you can actually buy.
We bring boutique curation to the Internet’s largest catalog.
It will not be based on the price

Etsy has great prices, fast shipping, excellent customer support,
and a massive catalog. Only linking to Etsy makes things simple and predictable.

I will have an extension Chrome/Firefox/Safari, a Website, and an Iphone App
The website need the api Etsy to works and is based on affiliate marketing.

Customer will be able to use their brand, subscribe and collect products.
People will be able to like and add to collection each product from Etsy with the extension.
